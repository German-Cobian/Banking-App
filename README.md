# Banking-App


A how-to on building a basic React-Redux app. The user can deposit a hundred dollars at a time to a purported bank account,

![Start at 300](/public/300.png?raw=true "Start at 300")
![Deposit 100](/public/400.png?raw=true "Deposit 100")

...or withdraw the same amount.

![Start at 400](/public/400.png?raw=true "Start at 400")
![Withdraw 100](/public/300.png?raw=true "Withdraw 100")

The project is based on the tutorial video [React Redux (with Hooks) Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jULHSe41ls) by "Laith Harb."

were implemented. 

* `reducers-store` Implements the reducers for deposit and withdrawal and combines them into a single reducer / Implements store which receives the combined reducers.

* `providers-selectorHook` Imports the provider so that every single component can access store / Implements the useSelector hook so as to acces the state in the store.

* `action-creators` Implements the action creators so as to dispatch the  withdraw and deposit actions / Implements bindActionCreators method to do just what the name suggests as well as the useDispatch hook so that these actions are passed on to the reducers and update store in accordance with the actions.
